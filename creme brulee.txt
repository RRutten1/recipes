Creme Brûlée is a classic French dessert with a rich custard base and a crispy caramelized sugar topping. Here's a recipe for making this delightful dessert:

**Ingredients:**

For the Custard:
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 5 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 vanilla bean or 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract

For the Caramelized Sugar Topping:
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).

2. **Prepare the Custard Base:**
   - If using a vanilla bean, split it open lengthwise, scrape the seeds out with the back of a knife, and add both the seeds and the empty pod to a saucepan with the heavy cream. Heat the cream over medium heat until it's just about to boil, then remove it from the heat. If using vanilla extract, simply add it to the cream.
   
3. **Whisk Egg Yolks and Sugar:**
   - In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until they're well combined and slightly thickened.

4. **Temper the Eggs:**
   - Slowly pour the hot cream into the egg yolk and sugar mixture, whisking constantly. This process is called tempering and ensures that the eggs don't cook too quickly when combined with the hot cream.

5. **Strain the Mixture:**
   - Strain the custard mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large pouring jug or bowl to remove any clumps or the vanilla bean pod.

6. **Prepare the Ramekins:**
   - Place 4-6 (depending on their size) ramekins or custard dishes in a deep baking dish. Fill the baking dish with hot water until it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. This water bath will help the custards cook evenly.

7. **Pour the Custard:**
   - Pour the custard mixture evenly into the ramekins.

8. **Bake:**
   - Place the baking dish in the preheated oven. Bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the custards are set around the edges but still slightly wobbly in the center.

9. **Chill:**
   - Remove the ramekins from the water bath and allow them to cool at room temperature. Then, refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but overnight is even better.

10. **Caramelize the Sugar:**
    - Just before serving, sprinkle a thin, even layer of granulated sugar over the top of each custard. You can use a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar by moving the flame evenly over the surface until it turns golden brown and forms a crispy layer. Alternatively, you can place the ramekins under a broiler for a few minutes until the sugar caramelizes, but be sure to watch them closely to prevent burning.

11. **Serve:**
    - Let the caramelized sugar cool and harden for a few minutes, then serve the creme brûlée immediately. It's best enjoyed while the caramelized top is still crispy.

Creme Brûlée is a delightful and elegant dessert that's sure to impress your guests. Enjoy!
