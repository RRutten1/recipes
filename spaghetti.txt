Classic Spaghetti with Tomatosauce:

**Ingredients:**

For the Sauce:
- 1 (28-ounce) can of crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar (to balance the acidity of the tomatoes)
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the Spaghetti:
- 8 ounces (about 2 cups) of dried spaghetti
- Salt for cooking pasta
- Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent, about 5 minutes.
   - Add the minced garlic and sauté for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant, but be careful not to brown the garlic as it can become bitter.
   - Add the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir well.
   - Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. This allows the flavors to meld, and the sauce to thicken.

2. **Cook the Spaghetti:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes).
   - Drain the cooked spaghetti in a colander.

3. **Combine the Sauce and Spaghetti:**
   - Toss the cooked and drained spaghetti with the tomato sauce in the saucepan. This allows the pasta to absorb some of the sauce's flavors.
   - If you prefer, you can also serve the sauce on top of individual portions of spaghetti.

4. **Serve:**
   - Plate the spaghetti, garnish with fresh basil leaves (if available), and offer grated Parmesan cheese at the table for those who want to add it.

5. **Enjoy!**
