**Ingredients:**

For the falafel:
- 1 1/2 cups dried chickpeas (or 3 cups canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed)
- 1 small onion, roughly chopped
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to your spice preference)
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1/2-1 teaspoon baking powder
- 4-6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- Vegetable oil for frying

**For the tahini sauce:**
- 1/2 cup tahini
- 2-3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Salt to taste

**Instructions:**

**For the falafel:**

1. If using dried chickpeas, place them in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Allow them to soak for at least 12 hours or overnight. Drain well.

2. Place the drained chickpeas, onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, cumin, coriander, cayenne, salt, and black pepper in a food processor. Pulse until the mixture is well combined but still a little coarse.

3. Sprinkle in the baking powder and 4 tablespoons of flour, then pulse the mixture. Add more flour as needed, one tablespoon at a time, until the mixture can be formed into balls without sticking to your hands. It should hold together but not be too dense.

4. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least an hour to allow it to firm up.

5. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep pan or pot to 350-375°F (175-190°C). It's hot enough when a small piece of the mixture sizzles when dropped in.

6. Form the mixture into small balls or patties (usually about 1.5 inches in diameter).

7. Carefully place the falafel into the hot oil using a slotted spoon or spider strainer. Fry until they are deep golden brown, about 3-4 minutes.

8. Remove the falafel from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.

**For the tahini sauce:**

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, water, olive oil, minced garlic, and salt until smooth and well combined.

**To serve:**

Serve the freshly fried falafel in pita bread or flatbread with your choice of toppings, such as shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and a drizzle of tahini sauce. Enjoy your homemade falafel!
